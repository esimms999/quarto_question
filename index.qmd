This page is a celebration of Eric. And what makes him very happy: RETIREMENT!

Eric's last working day is August 2, 2024.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# today_date <- Sys.Date()
today_date <- as.Date("02aug2024", "%d%b%Y")

days <- as.numeric(as.Date("2aug2024", "%d%b%Y") - today_date + 1)

if(days < 0) {
  msg <- cat("Today is", format(today_date, "%B %d, %Y"), ". Eric has already been retired", abs(days), "days.")
} else {
  msg <- cat("Today is", format(today_date, "%B %d, %Y"), ". Eric has", days, "days before he is done.")
}


```
