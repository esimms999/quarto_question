This page is a celebration of Eric. And what makes him very happy: RETIREMENT!

Eric's last working day is August 2, 2024.

```{r}
#| echo: false
today_date <- Sys.Date()
# today_date <- as.Date("04aug2024", "%d%b%Y")

days <- as.numeric(as.Date("2aug2024", "%d%b%Y") - today_date)
if (abs(days) == 1) {
  days_text <- "1 day"
} else {
  days_text <- paste(abs(days), "days")
}

if(days == 0) {
  cat("Today is ", format(today_date, "%B %d, %Y"), ". Eric will hand in the laptop, charger, \nbuilding pass and Amex card. Done!", sep = "")
  } else {
    if(days < 0) {
      msg <- cat("Today is ", format(today_date, "%B %d, %Y"), ". Eric has already been retired ", days_text, ".", sep = "")
      } else {
        msg <- cat("Today is ", format(today_date, "%B %d, %Y"), ". Eric has ", days_text, " before he is done.", sep = "")
      }
    }
